title: pentaflower
intro: Pentaflower is a mathematical function, a formulaic yet intricate expression. The pieces you see here are not static images; each pentagon was drawn point-by-point onto an svg canvas by your browser as it rendered this webpage, following my instructions in the form of javascript code. It would not quite be fair to call myself the author of these works. I did not imagine these patterns. I did not invent these names. I created a simple set of rules, and watched as mathematics took these rules and turned them into complex, beautiful, and amusingly-titled arrangements.
